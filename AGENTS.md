- ☑ it's still not persisting after refresh!!!
- ☑ somehow when creating a new task, while it doesn't 0-out the previous task, it does 0 out ALL tasks prior to that for some reason... any idea why!?

- ☒ it should persist-sync state in localstorage
- ☑ when creating a task it should also start that task
- ☑ when a task loses focus it should change from current session: xx seconds to keep those seconds (currently it resets to 0 immediately.. no, it should only reset when that task is clicked again) it should just replace "current" with "last" in session label
